# Historical Extreme Rainfall Events
The Climate Team needs to serve historical data for global extreme rainfall events in a format that can be easily consumed by business intelligence tools such as Power BI.

## Problem Statement:
Calculate an extreme rainfall event metric from the daily surface precipitation output of a climate model for the years 1994-2014, and visualise the historical data using maps and graphs using Python.
The metric for extreme rainfall events is the annual maximum precipitation amount in millimetres.

## Data Used:
The data is extracted from the following S3 Bucket: [NEX-GDDP-CMIP6](https://nex-gddp-cmip6.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/index.html#NEX-GDDP-CMIP6/ACCESS-CM2/historical/r1i1p1f1/pr/)
